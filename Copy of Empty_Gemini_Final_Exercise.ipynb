These embeddings represent the summaries in a numerical format suitable for efficient similarity searches.\n","4. **Creating a Vector Database**: A Vector database was created to store the embeddings. This database facilitates fast and efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on similarity searches. We chose to use Chroma DB.\n","5. **Querying the RAG System**: For a given query, the system retrieves the most relevant documents (based on their embeddings) and generates a response using the retrieved documents as context.\n","\n","Something important to note is that RAGs are usually used only when there is a surplus of data.
